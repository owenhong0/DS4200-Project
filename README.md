# DS4200-Project

# Github Conventions
- As general organization, its good to create branches for each new thing we do and incrementally merge in branches
- - We can categorize into: feat, chore, fix -> as branch name headers to describe what we are doing i.e "feat: add new bar plot"

- Before creating your own branch or starting new work, merge changes from remote into your branch, or if you are starting on main just pull from remote into local main

## Creating your own branch:
1. Either using git commands or in the IDE, create branch from main and name it
2. Everytime you jump back into an open branch at the start of a work sesh, please merge in remote changes
3. Commit and create pull requests to merge branches into main

# Running the Web App
1. At its core you have to cd into the frontend directory and run "npm run start" in your terminal (this will run the script in package.json)
2. (Optional) You can create your own run configuration so you can just hit a button to start the server, look at screenshot below.
3. Navigate to localhost:3000 to see web project
