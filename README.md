# DS4200-Project

# Github Conventions
- As general organization, its good to create branches for each new thing we do and incrementally merge in branches
- - We can categorize into: feat, chore, fix -> as branch name headers to describe what we are doing i.e "feat: add new bar plot"

- Before creating your own branch or starting new work, merge changes from remote into your branch, or if you are starting on main just pull from remote into local main

## Creating your own branch:
1. either using git commands or in the IDE, create branch from main and name it
2. everytime you jump back into an open branch at the start of a work sesh, please merge in remote changes
3. commit and create pull requests to merge branches into main
